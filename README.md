- 👋 Hi, I’m Jack Hughes, a recent Robotics Graduate from The University of the West of England.
- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded Systems, Robotics, Machine Learning and a bit of web development.
- 🎓 Recently graduated from The University of the West of England with a 2:1.
- 🐲 Originally from Somerset, now based in Bristol.
- 🎿 In my spare time, I make music, read, go climbing, ski and hang out with people who are probably smarter than I am.
- 📫 You can find me in the following places:
  -  [email](jackmhughes1998@gmail.com.)
  -  [LinkedIn]()

My code generally deals with one of the following categories:
- Embedded Systems - working with microcontrollers and periopheral inputs and outputs.
- Vectorisation in python using Numpy or Pandas. (I need to learn Numba and CUDA too!)
- Data Analysis and visualisation using Python
-
